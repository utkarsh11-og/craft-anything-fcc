# Attribution

Third-party material bundled with `craft_anythingXFCC`, file by file. Rust crates are pulled
from crates.io under their own licences (see `Cargo.lock`) and are not listed here.

## Fonts (`assets/fonts/`)

All fonts are under the SIL Open Font License 1.1. The fonts are embedded unmodified; the
licence requires that the font software is not sold by itself and that reserved font names are
not used for modified versions.

## egui default fonts (`epaint_default_fonts` crate)

egui embeds these fonts through the `epaint_default_fonts` crate (crate licence:
`(MIT OR Apache-2.0) AND OFL-1.1 AND Ubuntu-font-1.0`). They are embedded unmodified; the
licence texts are in the crate's `fonts/` folder.

## App icon (`assets/app-icon/`)

The app icon artwork in this directory is the XFCC replacement artwork created for this project.
It replaces the original Craft Anything raven icon and is not an ArtCraft asset. The icon artwork
is project-specific; the repository's MIT OR Apache-2.0 licence applies to the surrounding
project code and does not by itself establish a separate licence for this artwork.

`trace.py` is a tool covered by the repository's MIT OR Apache-2.0 licence.

## Upstream brand notice

`docs/brand/LICENSE-brand.txt` is retained as an upstream notice concerning the ArtCraft name
and marks. The ArtCraft name, wordmark, and logos are not used as the identity of this modified
project. This project is an independent modified fork and is not affiliated with or endorsed by
the ArtCraft Team.

## Optional build-time fonts

Builds made with `CRAFT_FONTS_DIR` (craft-fonts), releases among them, also embed the fonts in
that folder (all OFL-1.1). Their packages ship each one's licence as `OFL-<font>.txt`; craft-fonts'
own `ATTRIBUTION.md` names their authors and pinned sources.
